        <p><em> Master of Science in Computer Science Student @<strong><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms" target="_blank">NYU Tandon
                School of Engineering</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a learner by heart. I began my career as a Technical
          Recruiter but the <em>tech</em> attracted me more than
          recruiting and that was when I decided
          to make a career change.</p>
        <p>After completing NYU's Bridge to Tandon Program, a highly competitive CS graduate School
          preparative program for students like me, I got admitted to New York University's Master in Science in Computer
          Science program, where I can study difficult topics in CS including Algorithms
          and Artificial Intelligence. This program is ranked as one of the top 30 Computer
          Science programs in United States.</p>
